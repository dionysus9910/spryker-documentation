        <h3>Navigation Overview</h3>
        <p class="info">Every shop can have several independent navigation trees. For instance, there can be the main navigation that contains links to category pages or content pages.</p>
        <p class="note">The main difference to Categories is that a Category Tree represents a hierarchical structure for the Products while a Navigation is just a nested list of links.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Structure</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>An entry in the Navigation has a name.</li>
            <li>The underlying tree structure is represented by Navigation Nodes.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>node_type</i> - can be "category", "link, "external_url", "cms_page" or "label".</li>
            </ul>
            <li>There is one URL per localized Navigation Node. The URL is the only link to the resource. There are no other relations in the schema.</li>
        </ul>

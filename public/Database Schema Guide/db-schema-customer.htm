        <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Customer Schema</h2>
        <h3>Customer with Addresses</h3>
        <p>Customers can register themselves directly or during the checkout. They can log in and log out to the shop and use the password forgotten mechanism.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Structure</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Customer</b>: Here we save the basic information like the name and the preferred locale.</li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>spy_customer::customer_reference</i> - the Public reference to the customer which does not allow conclusions on the number of customers in the database.</li>
            </ul>
            <li><b>Address</b>: Each customer can have multiple addresses while only one of them can be the default billing and shipping address.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Customer Groups</h3>
        <p>Customers can be grouped so that they qualify for specific discounts. This feature can also be used for other use cases like "customer-group specific prices".</p>

        </p>
        <h3>Newsletter</h3>
        <p>Shop users can subscribe to the newsletter.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Databaase Schema Guide/newsletter.png" />
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Structure</b>:</li>
            <li>Newsletter subscribers are saved into <i>spy_newsletter_subscriber</i>.</li>
            <li>Subscribers can be related to existing customers or they can be standalone.</li>
            <li>Subscribers can be related to one or multiple subscriptions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">Spryker does not have a newsletter sending mechanism. The data need to be exported to an external tool.</p>
        <h3>Zed Users</h3>
        <p class="info">Customers can be related to Zed Users. This is used for rendering CMS Page reviews which regular users cannot see.</p>

        <p>Yves knows two types of URLs (see <var>YvesBootstrap</var>-&gt;<var>registerRouters()</var>).</p>
        <ol>
            <li>URLs that are defined in the database (e.g. for Product Detail, CMS or Category Pages).</li>
            <li>URLs that are defined in the code (e.g. for Cart and Checkout).</li>
        </ol>

        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Structure</span>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All URLs which are in the first category are stored in <var>spy_url</var>.</li>
            <li>Each URL is assigned to one Locale which means that there are multiple URLs per linked Resource (e.g. a Product Detail Page has one translated URL per Locale).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>URL Resources</h3>
        <p class="info">URLs are related to Resources. A Resource can be something like a Category- or a Product Detail Page. Each Resource has one URL per Locale.</p>

        <p><b>Structure</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Several Resources are related to URLs</li>
            <li>The <var>spy_url</var> table holds all the foreign keys but there is a constraint that only one of the foreign keys is possible (in other words: One URL cannot be related to more than one resource).</li>

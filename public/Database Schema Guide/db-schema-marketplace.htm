        <h3>Merchant and Merchant Relationships</h3>
        <p>A Merchant is someone who sells Products on a Marketplace. Merchants sometimes have special agreements with their customers. This agreement is represented as Merchant Relationship in Spryker.</p>
        <p class="note">This feature is being developed.</p>

        </p>
        <p><b>Structure</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A Merchant is identified by the name.</li>
            <li>The schema shows that a Merchant can have multiple Merchant Relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Merchant Relationship to Company Business Units</h3>
        <p class="info">In a B2B context, there are special agreements between a Merchant and "his" customers which are represented as Company Business Users in Spryker.</p>
        <p class="note">It may happen that a Business Unit gets contradicting Relationships with the same Merchant. This has to be obeyed in all use cases.</p>

        <p><b>Structure</b>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Merchant has Relationships with Company Business Units</li>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a one-to-many direct relation (<i>spy_merchant_relationship::fk_company_business_unit</i>) which defines the Company Business Unit that owns the Relationship to the Merchant and is able to manage it (e.g. "Hotel Management).</li>
                <li>There is also a many-to-many relation between the Merchant Relationship and the Company Business Unit which defines which Company Business Units are affected by the Relationship (e.g. "Hotel Bar", "Hotel Restaurant", "Hotel Spa").</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Relationships can be used for several uses cases:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>To restrict the products (from the Merchant) which the customers (~ Users of the related Company Business Unit) are allowed to see in the shop.</li>
                <li>To define a dedicated Price for the products (from the Merchant) which the customers (~ Users of the related Company Business Unit) are paying.</li>
            </ol>
        </ul>

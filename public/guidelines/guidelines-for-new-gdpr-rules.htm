        <h1>Guidelines for New GDPR Rules</h1>
        <p>As of May, the 25th 2018 the new General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) will take effect. This information describes the ways that the Spryker Commerce OS supports regulatory compliance with the GDPR.</p>
        <p>GDPR contains rules relating to the protection and control of personal data. <br />For more information about GDPR, see:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32016R0679">The official site</a>
            </li>
            <li>A nice online <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/">summary</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general terms of functionality, compliance is established through a customer’s ability to delete their account information and subscribe or unsubscribe to newsletters. Shop owners can delete customer accounts through the Administration Interface. In both cases, these actions do not affect billing and order related information. The process of deleting an account anonymizes customer information and address data but retains the relevant transaction details.</p>
        <p>However, Spryker has no complete access to customer implementations and has no control systems that are implemented and deployed. Therefore, we can only provide partial aid with GDPR compliance by providing features (like account deletion or consent withdrawal) to support customers becoming GDPR compliant.</p>
        <p>To further support our customers, we compiled a few notes and guidelines that can help. This information does not in any way replace any kind of official legal consulting which needs to be done by the customers themselves in order to be adjusted to each company’s business model. Moreover, all customers use 3rd party and own integrations with their tech infrastructure (DB, log files, CRM, mail providers) and need to oversee GDPR compliance of those connections too.</p>

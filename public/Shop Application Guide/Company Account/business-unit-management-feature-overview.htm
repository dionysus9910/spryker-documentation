        <h1>Business Units Management Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>Once a company administrator has created a company which has been activated and approved in the Administrator Interface, they can start building the organizational structure of their company in <i>My Company</i> section of the web-shop. The very first step of defining the company structure is setting up business units and creating the <b>business units hierarchy</b>. The business units hierarchy poses a system in which business units are arranged into levels: upper, lower and the same. The business unit of the upper level is referred to as <b>parent business unit</b>, and the business units below it are its <b>child business units</b>. Upon company registration, a default business unit named "Headquarters" is automatically created under <i>Business Units</i> section.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The company administrator can create, edit, delete as well as arrange business units in hierarchical order there. To create a business unit, its name and email address must be specified. The user can also select a parent business unit of the newly created unit, however if it is not selected, the new business unit will be created with "0" level in hierarchy, i.e. as a parent.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The parent and child business units are visually differentiated by means of indents - 0 level business units (parents) have no indents before their lines, 1 level business units have a single indent before them, 2 level business units have a double indent etc.:</p>

        </p>
        <p>It is not possible to assign a parent business unit to its child. Also, deleting a parent business unit does not delete its children: the hierarchy is kept, and just goes one level up. That is, a business unit's children that are one level below it, become 0 level parent business units, and their children become 1 level children.</p>
        <p>A business unit can be assigned one or multiple addresses. The existing addresses can be assigned to business units already at the stage of their creation, and the new addresses can be added from <i>Edit Business Unit</i> page.</p>

        </p>
        <p>The addresses can also be unassigned by unchecking the respective address's checkbox  under <i>Assign Addresses</i> and clicking <i>Submit</i>.</p>

        </p>
        <p>This will move the address to <i>Unassigned addresses</i> section.</p>

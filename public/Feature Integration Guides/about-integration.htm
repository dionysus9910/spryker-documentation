        <h1>About Integration Guides</h1>
        <p>The integration guides provide step-by-step instructions on how to enable individual Spryker features for your project. </p>
        <p>Please keep in mind, that since Spryker Commerce OS is a highly modular system, you have total freedom in choosing what features to add to your project. When making a decision to install new features, we recommend not to bloat your project by installing everything, but opt for the features that are really justified in terms of your business needs. </p>
        <p>If you have spotted an issue with either of the guides, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/spryker/spryker-documentation/issues/new">create an issue</a> or pull request by using the Edit on GitHub option.</p>

        <h1>Search and Filters</h1>
        <p>Having a well-thought-out product search is a huge opportunity to provide an amazing shopping experience. It is one of the primary ways you can help customers find what they’re looking for. In our Zed Admin UI we have features that enable you to control search and filtering preferences and customize them in a manner that will improve your customers' user experience in your shop and help them quickly find what they are looking for. That means that search and filters customization actually influences your sales. </p>
        <p>In this section you will learn how to manage global filters, how to create and manage filters for a specific category as well as handle the search preferences.</p>

        <h1>Company Account</h1>
        <p>Company account is the main building block of the complex online B2B business model, as no B2B transaction is possible without a <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/capabilities/company_account/company_account_overview/company-account-general-organizational-structure.htm">company</a> and its related entities - <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/capabilities/company_account/company_account_overview/company-account-general-organizational-structure.htm">business units</a> and <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/capabilities/company_account/company_account_overview/company-account-general-organizational-structure.htm">company users</a> with specific <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/capabilities/company_account/company_user_permissions/company-roles-permissions.htm?tocpath=Capabilities%7CCompany%20Account%20Management%7C_____4">roles</a>. Even though <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/capabilities/company_account/company_user_permissions/company-roles-permissions.htm?tocpath=Capabilities%7CCompany%20Account%20Management%7C_____4">company account can be set up in the shop application itself</a>, it is also possible to create a company and its structure units directly in the Administration Interface. Moreover, after a Company has been registered in the shop application, it has to be approved by the back office administrator, which can be done on <a href="companies.htm">Companies</a> page. </p>

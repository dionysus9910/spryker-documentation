        <h1>Shipment</h1>
        <p>The carrier companies that you want to have integrated in the shop can be configured from the Zed Admin UI. For each carrier company you can add one or more shipment methods that you want to enable in the shop.</p>
        <p class="info">A carrier company refers to a company that provides shipment services (e.g.: DHL,UPS,etc.). A carrier company can have one or more shipment services associated (e.g.: Express Delivery, Standard Delivery).</p>
        <p>Next, we’ll help you create a carrier company from the Zed Admin UI and add a shipment service to it.</p>

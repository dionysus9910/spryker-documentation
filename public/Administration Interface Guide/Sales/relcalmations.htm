        <h1>Reclamations</h1>
        <p>To open this page, go to <b>Sales -&gt; Reclamations</b>.</p>
        <p>This page is where you can manage all order claims made by your customers. For example, sometimes your customers might want a replacement for their order, or refund, and in order not to become entangled in all such requests, you need a generic price to handle them all. The Reclamations page is just this very place.</p>
        <p class="info">When you create a reclamation for order items, the order items will only be marked as "Reclamation". The reclamations are not linked to order status or state machine. There are two reasons for this: first is that this would be different in every project and second is that claims have to be checked on an individual basis and may not influence order item status at all. Hence, the claimed order items are just "flagged" respectively, so that the operations team can take care of them and have an overview how many of these claims they have.</p>
        <p>From this page you can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#Viewing">View, and close reclamations</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#connected_order">Create a new order linked to a reclamation</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="#refund">Mark reclamation items as refunded</a>
            </li>
        </ul>

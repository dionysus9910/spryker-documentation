        <h1>Customers</h1>
        <p>Managing your customers effectively is an important part of your e-commerce business. The whole customers management is done through the Customers menu in the Administration Interface, which is divided into two section: <a href="customers.htm">Customers</a> and <a href="customer-groups.htm">Customer Groups</a>. <a href="customers.htm">Customers</a> is the area where all the data of users that have ever had an account in your web-shop is stored. Here you can create, edit and delete customers, as well as view their orders.</p>
        <p>From the <a href="customer-groups.htm">Customer Group</a> section, you can organize customers into groups that can share, for example, the same discounts or promotions.</p>

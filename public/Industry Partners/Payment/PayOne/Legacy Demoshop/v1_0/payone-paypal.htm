        <h1> PayOne - Paypal Payment <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/shoptype/B2C_Shop.png" /> <img src="../../../../../Resources/Images/shoptype/Demoshop.png" /></h1>
        <p>The payment using PayPal requires a redirect to PayPal website. When the customer is redirected to PayPal’s website, he must authorize himself and he has the option to either cancel or validate the transaction.
</p>
        <p>
A concern regarding payment flows that require redirection on third party website pages is that you loose control over the customers action ( the customer can close the browser before accepting or canceling the transaction). If this is the case, PayPal sends an instant payment notification (IPN) to Payone, then Payone notifies Spryker.

</p>
        <h2>Front-end Integration
</h2>
        <p>To adjust the frontend appearance, provide the following templates in your theme directory:

<var>src/&lt;project_name&gt;/Yves/Payone/Theme/&lt;custom_theme_name&gt;/e_wallet.twig</var></p>
        <p>PayPal Payment Integration with Payone:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
a <var>preAuthorize</var> command is submitted which leads to a redirect to PayPal webpage
</li>
            <li>redirect to PayPal webpage:
<ol><li>if browser is closed, a notification is sent to PayPal state machine
</li><li>after the customer chooses to accept or to cancel the transaction, a redirect is done back to the shop; the redirect URL indicates the option selected by the user ( accept/cancel transaction)
</li></ol></li>
            <li>a <var>captureCommand</var> is submitted if the customer has accepted the transaction on PayPals website.
</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>State Machine Integration
</h2>
        <p>Payone module provides a demo state machine for E-Wallet payment method which implements Preauthorization/Capture flow.

</p>
        <p>To enable the demo state machine, extend the configuration with following values:

</p><pre><code class="language-php line-numbers">&lt;?php
$config[SalesConstants::PAYMENT_METHOD_STATEMACHINE_MAPPING] = [
    ...
    PayoneConfig::PAYMENT_METHOD_E_WALLET =&gt; 'PayoneEWallet',
];

$config[OmsConstants::ACTIVE_PROCESSES] = [
    ...
    'PayoneEWallet',
];</code></pre>

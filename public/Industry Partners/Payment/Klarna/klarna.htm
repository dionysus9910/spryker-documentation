        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Draft">We use state machines for handling and managing orders and payments. To integrate Klarna payments, a dedicated state machine should be created.

</p>
        <p MadCap:conditions="General.Draft">A basic and fully functional state machine is already available (KlarnaPayment01). You can use the same state machine or build a new one. In case a new state machine needs to be built, it is preferred to contact Klarna and confirm the new state machine design and functionality.

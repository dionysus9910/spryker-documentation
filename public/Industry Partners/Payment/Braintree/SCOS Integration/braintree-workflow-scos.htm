        <h1>Braintree Workflow for SCOS <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/shoptype/MasterSuite.png" /></h1>
        <p>Both credit card and PayPal utilize the same request flow in <MadCap:variable name="General.ProductName" /> or SCOS. It  consists of the following requests:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Pre-check</b>: to check the user information to make sure that all the needed information is correct before doing the actual pre-authorization.</li>
            <li><b>Authorize</b>: to perform a payment risk check which is a mandatory step before every payment. The payment is considered accepted when it is authorized.</li>
            <li><b>Revert</b>: to cancel the authorization step which cancels the payment before capturing.</li>
            <li><b>Capture</b>: to capture the payment and receive money from the buyer.</li>
            <li><b>Refund</b>: to refund the buyer when returning products.</li>
        </ul>
    </body>

        <p>When a customer visits a page of a product which is out of stock, they usually search for the shop which has the product in stock. The shop administrator of the original store will replenish the stock, however, it does not mean that the customer will still be there to buy it. The Product is available again feature provides a way to notify you about the demand for the product, so you can prioritize the product replenishment, as well as notify the customer once it is done.


</p>
        <p>The feature works in a form of a newsletter for both guest users and registered ones. Guest users subscribe by entering the email address they would like to receive the notification to:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/guest-subscription.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Registered users subscribe to the newsletter in the same way, but the email address set up in their account is already entered when they visit a page with an out-of-stock product:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/registered-user-subscription.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Registered users can change the pre-entered email address to any other one.</p>
        <p>Once a customer subscribed, the email address input field is replaced with the <b>Do not notify me when back in stock</b> button.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/do-not-notify-button.png" />
        </p>
        <p>An email about a successful subscription is sent to the entered email address:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/successful-subscription.png" />
        </p>
        <p>If a customer clicks Do not notify me when back in stock, they will receive an email about a successful cancellation of the subscription:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/successful-unsubscription.png" />
        </p>
        <p>Those who subscribed to the newsletter will receive an email once the product is available, no matter how the status of availability becomes positive.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Mailing and Notifications/Product is Available Again/product-is-available.png" />
        </p>
        <p class="info">Each email sent as a part of the subscription, contains the unsubscribe from this list button as shown on the screenshot above.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Currently, there is no Zed UI for the feature. The newsletter text files are located in <var>/src/Spryker/Zed/AvailabilityNotification/Presentation/Mail</var>.</p>
        <p>Shop Administrator can check the list of subscriptions in <var>spy_availability_subscription</var> database table.</p>
        <p>The scheme below illustrates relations between Availability, AvailabilityNotification, AvailabilityNotificationWidget and ProductDetailPage modules:</p>

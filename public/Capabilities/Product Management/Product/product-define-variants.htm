            Spryker’s data structure for products allows to design a product hierarchy.
            The abstract product does not have stock, but defines various default properties for the descendant concrete products (product variants).
            The concrete product (product variant) always belongs to 1 abstract product and has a distinctive stock.
            The concrete products (product variants) of an abstract product always differ from each other with at least 1 super product attribute.
            In a multi-store environment the abstract product can be configured to appear only in specific stores. See further information about multi-store products <a href="../Product-Store Relation/product-store-relation.htm">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the example of a T-Shirt (abstract product) that is available in the sizes small, medium, and large (each size is a different product variant).
            The T-shirt appears in a category page or as a result of search.
            On the product detail page (PDP) customers can select from product variants and put them into the cart.

        <p>You can assign Product Labels to highlight specific products in your shop. Customize the look and text of the Labels as they appear in the shop. Any association can be a Label, such as "Sale" or "Christmas". 
Products that are new in your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label "New" for a predefined time range.
You can add validity dates to labels, sort them by importance or relevance and allow your customers to filter and search for them in your shop.</p>
        <p>Labels are mapped to products to highlight them in the shop. Customers can also filter products by their labels.

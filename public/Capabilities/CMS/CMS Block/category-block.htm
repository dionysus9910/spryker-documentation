        <h3>Category Blocks</h3>
        <p>Category blocks are blocks that can be embedded into the category template, for which we can specify on which specific categories we want them to be rendered.
		</p>
        <p>For example, we have a Christmas sale that affects the categories  related to toys and sweets. We want to apply the following discount rule for these categories: "When you buy 3 products from this category, the product with the lower price is  free". </p>
        <p>We would like to promote this sale by placing a block that displays the discount rule on the affected categories only.
</p>
        <h2>Product Blocks</h2>
        <p>Product blocks are blocks that can be embedded in the product template, for which we can specify on which specific product we want them to be rendered.
</p>

        <h1>Business on Behalf Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>Business unit includes a number of company users that have certain permissions within the business unit. For more information about business units, see <a href="../Company Account/Business Units Management/business-unit-management.htm">Business Unit Management</a>. This feature allows having multiple company users per customer account and provides a possibility to select 1 company user as default company user.</p>
        <p>Database relations before any changes were applied used to be schematically represented as follows:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>The Customer data is connected to the Company User in a one-to-one relationship. Thus, a customer account could only be linked to a one company user account.</p>
        <p>The aim of the Business on Behalf feature is having one-to-many relationships:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Business on Behalf/scheme2.PNG" />
        </p>
        <p>Thus, a single user has an ability to be logged in to several company accounts and manage all of them via a browser window.</p>
        <p class="info"><b>Prerequisite</b> <br />Only customers having more than one Company user accounts are able to make use of the feature.</p>
        <p>In the header section, the customer can see the Name of the company &amp; Name of the Business Unit they are currently operating in (e.g. Test-company / Business Unit 1).</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Clicking on the menu item in the Customer Account in the shop application navigates the customer to the <b>Change Company User</b> page where they can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>see all company user accounts assigned to the customer by Name of Company &amp; Name of the Business Unit (Format: COMPANY NAME / BUSINESS UNIT NAME).</li>
            <li>choose in the drop-down one of the company user accounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/Business on Behalf/change_company_user.png" />
        </p>
        <p><b>No company</b> value in the drop-down means that the user is yet logged in to no company accounts.</p>
        <p>To make the selection as a default, you will need to tick <b>Remember Choice</b> option.</p>

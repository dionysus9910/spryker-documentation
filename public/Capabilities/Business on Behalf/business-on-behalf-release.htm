            <p>Organizations with various business units, that support their own set of accounts, customers, and vendors often face challenges organizing procedural and management operations within them. Such organizations need some of their company users to be able to access (and eventually manage) not only one specific business unit, but several business units within the whole company. This can be achieved with the Business on Behalf feature which enables you to set up multiple company users for one customer account. This implies, that the company user can be assigned to multiple business units with different roles and permissions, which allows you to configure user access to match your organization's policies and procedures. For example, as a shop owner, you might have a financial manager in your company, who for audit purposes, should be able to access company business units' accounts to check their order histories, shopping lists etc.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>grant access to company's subdivisions to manage the business units;</li>
                <li>implement corporate process related to management, audit, purchases, and even more.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>On a B2B Level, you can offer specific prices to different customers. This is easily handled by matching a Company, Business Unit, or Customer Group with the special prices you agreed on.</p>
        <p>The user in the front end will always see the assigned prices for products no matter if they are on the product page, in the search, or in the Cart. Simultaneously, the Sales Agent will see the prices per customer in the backend.</p>
        <p>Customer Specific Prices are stored per Customer ID on a company level and are matched on a daily basis for any updates. </p>

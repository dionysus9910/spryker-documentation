        <p>Make your shop more appealing and give your customers a better idea of what they are buying with Images and Image Sets. Group several images into sets and link them to products. One product can have several named and localized sets of images, for example to present standard or seasonal highlights. 
Different image sets can be used in CMS Pages and Blocks, for marketing and promotional purposes or simply to increase branding in your store.

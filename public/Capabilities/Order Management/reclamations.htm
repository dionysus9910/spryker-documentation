        <p>Effectively support the customer care operations and provide your sales agents with an easy-to-manage and clear overview of all Reclamations. 
Reclamations are easily created and managed and be connected to orders with a few simple clicks. A reclamation can also be converted into an entirely new order, as they present a sub-set of order items.
You can freely customize the reclamation workflow using the Spryker Commerce OS State Machine. </p>

            <li>No, it does not involve a refund. But on the project level, it can be easily done and reclamation button will be connected to refund. Reclamation was released this way because of the dependencies on state machine. We cant command what state machine must be used in projects. Refund </li>

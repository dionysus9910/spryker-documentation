        <p>The simple <b>Gift Cards</b> feature can help you increase website traffic, gain new customers and boost brand awareness. The purchase of a gift card generates an individual code that can then be used as a payment method during checkout. 
When paying with a gift card, customers are enabled to only use part of the total card value. The remaining value can be stored as leftover balance on the original code.
During the Gift Card purchase process, shipment prices can be omitted, if the card is send via email. Also, to avoid fraud, certain payment methods, such as invoice, can be faded out.

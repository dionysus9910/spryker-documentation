        <p>Customers can add products with options to shopping lists. That is, when adding products with options to a shopping list from product details page, the selected options are saved in the shopping list. Likewise, if products with options are added to a shopping list from cart, they are also saved in the shopping list.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Each option is added as a separate item to shopping list. </p>
        <p class="example">For example, if you chose a product with "red gift wrapping" option and also want the same product with "blue gift wrapping" option, there will ultimately be two products in your shopping list. Meaning, one for each product option: a product with the red gift wrapping, and the same product with the blue gift wrapping.</p>
        <p>The product options can be added and edited on the <i>Edit shopping list</i> page by selecting them in options drop-down list. However in case of shared shopping lists, this holds true only for owners and users with the<i>Full access</i> rights, as users with <i>Read only</i> permissions can not edit shopping lists:</p>

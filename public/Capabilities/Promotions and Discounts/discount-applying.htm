        <p>There are two ways of applying a discount to an order :</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet_list">for cart rule discounts : these discounts are contained in the cart and are calculated automatically</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">for voucher code discounts : these discounts must be added by the customer and they are calculated once they are entered</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cart Rule Discounts</h2>
        <p class="tip"><strong>Cart Rules Discounts</strong>
            <br />Cart Rule discounts are discounts that exist in the cart and don't need any input from the customer.</p>
        <p><strong>Cart Rule</strong> discounts are not linked to a discount voucher pool; they are contained in the cart and are calculated automatically.</p>
        <p>Example of cart rule discount : 10% Discount for all orders above €100</p>
        <table style="mc-table-style: url('../../Resources/TableStyles/VerticalTable.css');" class="TableStyle-VerticalTable" cellspacing="0">
            <col class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-Column-Column1">
            </col>
            <col class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-Column-Column2">
            </col>
            <tbody>
                <tr class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-Body-Body1">
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><strong>Decision Rule Query String</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyD-Column2-Body1">sub-total &gt;= “100”</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-Body-Body2">
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyE-Column1-Body2"><strong>Collector Query String</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyD-Column2-Body2">sku = “*”</td>
                </tr>
                <tr class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-Body-Body1">
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyB-Column1-Body1"><strong>Calculator Plugin</strong>
                    </td>
                    <td class="TableStyle-VerticalTable-BodyA-Column2-Body1">PLUGIN_CALCULATOR_PERCENTAGE</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>	The discount is included in the cart so it is being calculated automatically, without any other input from the customer.</p>
        <h2>Voucher Code Discounts</h2>
        <p><strong>Voucher Code</strong> discounts are discounts that are linked to a voucher pool. In order to be applied, the associated voucher code must be entered by the customer. Once the voucher code is submitted, the calculation of the discount can be performed.</p>
        <p>The voucher codes associated to a discount voucher pool can be used once (<var>max_number_of_uses</var> = 1) or can be used many times as long as the discount is valid (<var>max_number_of_uses</var> = 0).</p>
        <p>Example of infinitely usable voucher codes : a 50% discount is offered to registered customers on orders containing at least 3 items, on the least expensive item (a voucher code is sent by email to registered customers). The voucher code sent to the customers is the same and it has set <var>max_number_of_uses</var>=0.</p>
        <p>The way a voucher code discount is defined similar to the cart rule discount. The only difference is the voucher code and the number of uses.</p>
        <p>
            Note: From discount version 5, we have introduced multi-currency and price mode to discount module. This means that when building your cart rule, you must use currency or price-mode decision rules to filter discount per currency or price mode.
            This is not needed if shop is running in a single currency or a single price mode.

            </p>
        <p>This is how the decision rule looks like if conditions are applied to discount only when subtotal is more than per currency, price mode:<![CDATA[
            ]]></p>
        <p>Query:
            <pre><code class="language-PHP line-numbers">( price-mode = 'GROSS_MODE' AND ( ( sub-total &gt;= '600' AND currency = 'EUR' )  OR ( sub-total &gt;= '700' AND currency = 'CHF' )  )  )  OR ( price-mode = 'NET_MODE' AND ( ( sub-total &gt;= '550' AND currency = 'EUR' )  OR ( sub-total &gt;= '630' AND currency = 'CHF' )  )  )</code></pre><![CDATA[

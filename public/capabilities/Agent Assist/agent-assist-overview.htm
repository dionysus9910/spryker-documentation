        <h1>Agent Assist Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>An <b>agent</b> is a person who helps customers to perform various activities in an online store. For example, a customer might call an agent and ask him/her to help choose a right product and assist in the buying process or even perform some actions in the web-shop for them. Say the customer is willing to add items to shopping list, or create a company, but can not do it for some reason. This is when the agent comes in and provides practical support by carrying out actions on customer's behalf in the web-shop.</p>
        <p>The agent user can be created in the Admin UI under <i>Users Control → User</i>. In fact, any Admin UI user can be agent, all you need to do for that is check the box <i>This user is an agent</i> on the <i>User create/edit</i> page, and the user gets the Agent mark. See <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/administration_interface_guide/users_control/user.htm?tocpath=Administration%20Interface%7CAdministration%20Interface%20Guide%7CUsers%20Control%7C_____1">Adding New Users</a> to learn more how to create a new agent user in the Admin UI.</p>

        <p>To act on customer's behalf, the agent signs it to web-shop with the agent account and selects the right customer by typing their name or email in the customer search field.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Once necessary customer is found in the customer search field, the agent clicks Confirm. This virtually logs the agent in to the web-shop under the selected customer, so he/she sees the webshop just the way the customer does: with all their wishlists, shopping lists etc. and can do anything the customer asked for. If customer's cart is stored in the database (not in session), the agent sees the cart and all its items as well.</p>
        <p>Having performed the necessary actions requested by the customer, the agent ends the customer assistance session by clicking End Customer Assistance.</p>

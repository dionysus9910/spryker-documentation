        <p>To meet the needs of your business partners, the Spryker Commerce OS allows them to request an offer or quote for products and services you sell. 
Your sales agents can offer individual deals by manipulating item prices in the order form and thus propose the best deals to your customers. Adding the Manual Order Entry feature, your sales agents can also quickly create an order out of an existing offer. To simplify the Offer Management process, the same offer can be sent to multiple customers.
Net and gross prices are incorporated based on your system configurations. </p>
        <p>A customer is able to request an offer with best prices and Zed User is able to suggest an offer to a customer.</p>

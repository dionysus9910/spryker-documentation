        <h1>Reclamations Feature Overview</h1>
        <p>Once the shop administrator has received a claim regarding an order from the customer, he/she can go to <b><a href="https://documentation.spryker.com/administration_interface_guide/sales/orders.htm#creating-order-claims">Overview of Orders</a></b> in the Administration Interface and click <b>Claim</b> to register the claim for the order (for all items or separate items of the order). </p>
        <p>After the reclamation has been created, it appears on the <b><a href="https://documentation.spryker.com/administration_interface_guide/sales/relcalmations.htm">Reclamations</a></b> page under the <b>Sales</b> menu in the Administration Interface. Each reclamation is linked to a specific order, however one and the same order can have more than one reclamation.</p>
        <p>With the reclamations in place, you can basically do three things: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://documentation.spryker.com/administration_interface_guide/sales/manual-order-entry.htm">create a new connected order</a>, </li>
            <li>return money paid for the order, i.e. make a refund</li>
            <li>close the reclamation</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="important">Due to specificity of the state machine for every project, out of the box, the “refunded” state is not reflected in OMS in any way - it is just a mark for the shop administrators signifying that the order has been refunded.</p>
        <p>The reclamations can have two states - open and closed. Closed state of a reclamation means that there is nothing to do on it anymore, therefore it can not be reopened.</p>

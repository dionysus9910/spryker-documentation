            <br />Spryker allows to define different tax sets that include one to many different tax rates.</p>
        <h2>Tax Set - Tax Rate Association</h2>
        <p>A tax set has associated at least one tax rate. For products on which there aren’t applied any taxes : associate the abstract product to a tax set that has associated a tax rate with rate set to 0.</p>
        <h2>Tax Set - Abstract Product Association</h2>
        <p>An abstract product must have one tax set associated to it. The other way around, a tax set can be associated to 0 to n abstract products. Concrete products don’t have an associated tax set ( they apply only to abstract products)</p>
        <p>Example of tax sets :</p>
        <p>Tax set: “Low Tax Rate Germany” has 1 tax rate 7%. Tax set: “VAT Canada Quebec” has 2 tax rates 5% GST (Goods and Services Tax) and 9.7% QST (Québec Sales Tax).</p>

        <p>Align your business with international tax standards by defining tax rates and sets. 
Determine country-based tax rates for products, options and shipments, that will automatically be applied to the respective shops.
Group and name a set of tax rates that apply to certain product groups and countries.
You can easily import predefined tax rates and sets.

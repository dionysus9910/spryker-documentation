        <h2>Price Per Business Unit</h2>
        <p>Offer your customers individual agreements and customize the Prices per Business Unit accordingly. The Spryker Commerce OS allows you to display different prices in your web shop. To avoid unnecessary repetition of values, the data is compressed in the database. You can also implement other price dimensions than "price per business unit", such as "price per postcode".

</p>
        <p>In a B2B environment, customers often have individual deals with their business partners. This includes agreements on prices per product. In order to accurately represent the business realities, B2B web-shops need the ability to show different prices per business unit.</p>
        <p>- Compression of data in database to avoid unnecessary repetition of values
</p>
        <p>- Technical: instead of "price per business unit" you can also implement other price dimensions with reasonable effort e.g. "price per postcode"</p>

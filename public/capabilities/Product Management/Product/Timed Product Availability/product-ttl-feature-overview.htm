        <h1>Timed Product Availability Feature Overview <img src="../../../../Resources/Images/shoptype/B2B_Shop.png" /></h1>
        <p>Timed product availability, or product TTL (Time to Live) allows you to define when your products are available online and when they are not. To get the main idea of the TTL, go to the general feature overview for more detailed information on how it works as well as familiarize yourself with its usage scenarios.</p>
        <h2>Timed product availability Feature Details</h2>
        <p>The Timed Product Availability feature is implemented through <var>isActive</var> field by introducing two more fields for product concretes in the Administration Interface - "Valid from" and "Valid to". A product can have exactly one "life" - one (or no) start, one (or no) end. If the "Valid from" date has not come yet, or if "Valid to" has been reached, the value of <var>isActive</var> field is set to "false" and the product is invisible for customers. This being said, the product validity settings overrule manual (de)activation of products, which means that, if, for example, a product has been manually set to "Deactivated" but has "Valid from" and Valid to" values specified, and "Valid to" lies in the future, the product will be displayed until after the time set in "Valid to" field. To deactivate the product in this case, it would be necessary to clear the values in the "Valid from" and "Valid to" fields.</p>
        <p>Time set for the product validity "Valid from" and Valid to" fields is accurate up to the minute. However, technically it is possible to change the accuracy (up to the second or up to the days) via a cronjob. The time is set in GMT by default.</p>
        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>The table below shows possible usage scenarios with the TTL feature and resulting system behavior.</p>

They don’t have stock, but a SKU that is linked to product abstracts. They cannot be bought without buying a corresponding product.
            Example product options are insurances or gift wrappings for products. Neither of them is sold normally without the actual main product.
        </p><p>
            Product options are connected to abstract products. They appear in groups, since each group can have multiple product option values. Each product option value has a unique identifier and price configuration.
            On the group level, a tax set is attached to the product option values. Each option group can be linked to many different abstract products and vice versa.

            Product Options in the Legacay Demoshop<![CDATA[       ]]></h3><p>
            For customers, the options are displayed on the product detail page of the abstract product.
            The product option price is added to the product price in the cart.
</p><p>You can assign Product Labels to highlight specific products in your shop. Customize the look and text of the Labels as they appear in the shop. Any association can be a Label, such as "Sale" or "Christmas". 
Products that are new in your shop can automatically be marked with the Dynamic Product Label "New" for a pre-defined time range.
</p><p>You can easily offer services on top of a customer's choice of products, such as gift wrapping, insurance, warranty or anything else that you may want to add that is not physically part of the product. The options can have their own price value and will be added to the total cart value. </p><p>Product options are additional items with costs (kostenpflichtig) but without an own stock. Customers can (only) buy them in addition to a product.</p><ul><li>Multiple independent product options for one product</li></ul><p>
    Product options allow to configure a product further. You can define option types and each option type can have 1 to n options values.
    Furthermore, multiple prices can be attached to an option value depending on current currency and price mode.
    <MadCap:dropDown><MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Example</MadCap:dropDownHotspot></MadCap:dropDownHead><MadCap:dropDownBody>
            You want to sell a piece of artwork as a product abstract and you want to allow to the customers to customize the frame they buy.
            You can define each frame type as a different option value for your product abstract.
            Each frame (product option value) can have different prices per currency and price mode (net/gross).
            <ol><li>Option value 1 - Default frame: costs gross 10€ (only available in gross EUR)</li><li>Option value 2 - No frame: costs net 50€, gross 60€, net 20CHF, gross 30CHF</li><li>Option value 3 - Stylish frame: costs net 150€, gross 160€ (not available in CHF)</li><li>Option value 4 - Old style frame: costs net 100€, net 100CHF (not available in gross mode)</li></ol></MadCap:dropDownBody></MadCap:dropDown></p><p>The concept is pretty close to the variants concept, however if the number of possible combinations gets too big or if options have specific prices or if options exclude other options, the product option concept is better suited than the variant concept.
    A configuration of a product is called the set of option value selections for each option type. The set of all possible configurations is called the configuration space.
    For a concrete product one default configuration can be stored. This will be used on the product detail page for the initial configuration of the product.</p><p>In general an option does not have a stock.</p><ul><li class="bullet_list">You can assign a tax set to a product option.

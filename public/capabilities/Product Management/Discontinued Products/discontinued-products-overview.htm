        <h2>Out of Stock vs. Discontinued Products</h2>
        <p>While we try to keep all the items in stock, we occasionally run out of products. In such a case the concrete product is tagged as out of stock and cannot be added to cart:</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once the stock is updated with the positive number - the concrete product will be available for purchase.</p>
        <p>Products are <b>discontinued</b> when the manufacturer or a current distributor has communicated that the product will no longer be produced. Still, the discontinued product may have stock (the stock number can either be positive or negative). </p>
        <p>Discontinued products have a certain period of time when they will still be shown on the website (<var>active_until</var>). After this period ends - the products will become deactivated.</p>
        <p class="note">Only <a href="../Product/product-abstraction.htm#bstract">concrete</a> products can become discontinued.</p>
        <p>The schema below illustrates the relations between discontinued products, abstract and concrete products:</p>

        <h2>Mark Product as "Discontinued" in the Administration Interface</h2>
        <p>To mark the product as "discontinued", a Store Administrator needs to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li> log in to the <b>Administration Interface</b> and vavigate to <b>Products &gt; Products</b>.</li>
            <li>Select the abstract product, choose its variant and click <i>Edit</i>:
				<p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Discontinued Products/edit-button.png" /></p></li>
            <li>On the <i>Edit Concrete Product</i> page, the shop owner has a new tab called <b>Discontinue</b>. By clicking on this tab, a Store Administrator can discontinue the concrete product.
			<p class="info">When the product is discontinued, <b>Discontinued</b> is colored in red.</p></li>
            <li>Once <b>Discontinue</b> is selected, a Store Administrator needs to add a note describing the reason why the product was discontinued. 
			<p>The date of the deactivation is also available for a Store Administrator on the <b>Discontinue</b> tab.</p><p><img src="../../../Resources/Images/Discontinued Products/discontinued-note.png" style="max-width: 60%;" /></p><p>Days left (<var>active_until</var>) value is set to 180 days by default. You can change it on project level.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <p>After the product is marked as discontinued, a corresponding label appears on the product detail page and search results in the shop application. Such product cannot be added to cart.</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../../Resources/Images/Discontinued Products/discontinued-product.png" style="max-width: 80%;" />
        </p>
        <p>If the product added to shopping list or wishlist is marked as discontinued, the <i>Discontinued</i> status will appear in the list and the shopper will not be able to proceed to the checkout:</p>

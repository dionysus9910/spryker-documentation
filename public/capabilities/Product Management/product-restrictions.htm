        <p>As a Company selling to other businesses, tailoring the product selection per customer is an important feature.</p>
        <p>Some items or prices are available specifically for certain clients and thus should not be accessible to others.</p>
        <p>With a Product Restriction feature, you as a shop owner can easily define which of your customers gets to see what items, details, and prices. Any item in your product catalog can be added to blacklists per customer. The lists can be uploaded or imported to make handling easier.</p>

        <p>Product Relations let you define a list of items that will be displayed as comparable or additional products. To up-sell items, you can build a set of suggestions to offer upscale product versions or additional fixtures to maximize the cart value. You can also easily establish product associations that let your customers see recommendations of products they might also like, to encourage cross-selling. 
You can choose to either use Spryker's condition rule builder to manually define relations or import the information from an external source.
</p>
        <p>An abstract product can be related to other abstract products for cross- and up selling purposes. For instance to show "similar products" on a product detail page. </p>
        <p>- Different types of relations for different use cases (e.g. "up-selling", “cross-selling”, “similar products”)
</p>
        <p>- Assign related products by a query builder (e.g. all products with a specfic attribute) </p>
        <p>E-Commerce shops maximize value for their shop visitors by helping them explore products that are related to the one they are currently interested in. These relations appear in different ways such as displaying similar products, upgrades of products (Product-relations), or simply products that fit into a certain context (Up-Selling). In our case these relations are defined manually by the shop owner in Zed.

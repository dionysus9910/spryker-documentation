        <h1>Split Delivery</h1>
        <p>With ever growing competition on e-commerce market, businesses seek ways to attract more customers. One of the well-known ways is to make customers' shopping experience easier and more convenient. That's exactly what the Split delivery feature does.</p>
        <p>The Split delivery feature enables your customers to distribute products from a single order across multiple shipment addresses, methods, carriers and delivery time frames instead of creating separate orders for those products. Let's say you have two keyboards and ten ink cartridges in your order. You can set one of the keyboards to be delivered to your office via UPS carrier with a shorter delivery time, but higher costs. The other keyboard is to be delivered to your home, but you are in no hurry with this one, so you choose DHL carrier with a longer delivery time, but lower costs. As you don't need all the ink cartridges delivered to you at once, half of them can be set to be delivered as soon as possible while the rest are to be delivered in several months. It's not only that this flexibility attracts customers, but simplifies order management for shop administrators too.</p>

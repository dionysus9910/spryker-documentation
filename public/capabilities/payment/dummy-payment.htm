        <p class="tip">Do not use this code for production but you can use it as a starting point for new payment integrations.</p>
        <p>What is the DummyPayment for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet_list">it brings a simple state machine</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">it shows how to integrate payment into the system</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">it shows how to handle refunds</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">it allows to test checkout process in several ways</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>State Machine</h2>
        <p>The module comes with a simple state machine which has a couple of states, commands and conditions. With that state machine it’s possible to trigger events for order items from Zed’s order detail page.</p>
        <h2>Integration</h2>
        <p>A couple of examples which shows how a payment is integrated into the system. These examples show:</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bullet_list">how to integrate forms into Yves checkout</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">how to add PaymentMethodHandler</li>
            <li class="bullet_list">how to add a state machine, commands and conditions to the <a href="../Order Management/oms-matrix.htm" target="_blank">Oms module</a></li>
            <li class="bullet_list">how to add CheckoutPlugins to the Payment module <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="General.Hidden Comment">Hyperlink to payment page when Hussam writes it TODO</MadCap:conditionalText></li>
            <li class="bullet_list">how to handle refunds with the <a href="Refund/refund.htm" target="_blank">Refund module</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>Refunds mostly triggered by a state machine command, this module shows how that could look like. Look into the <var>RefundPlugin</var>. This command can be triggered from Zed’s order detail page when a order item has the state <var>returned</var>.</p>
        <h2>Test Checkout</h2>
        <p>You can do an order as you already used to it. A way to test what happens when something after <var>saveOrder()</var> goes into the wrong direction has been added. A good example for this is when authorizing a payment fails.</p>
        <p>When “Invalid” is used as last name the order is saved but all items go into invalid state and the user is redirected to the <var>PaymentStep</var> of <a href="../Checkout/checkout-functionality.htm" target="_blank">Checkout</a>.</p>

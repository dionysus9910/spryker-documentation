        <h2>Documentation Search</h2>
        <p>There are two ways <b>to find the information</b>  you are looking for:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Using the Search function. Documentation search complies with the main Google search rules:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Search for an Exact Match: To search for an exact word or phrase, put it inside quotes. For example, <var>"shopping cart"</var>.</li>
                <li>Using Boolean Operators: You can use boolean operators to combine searches, search for one word or the other and exclude search terms.
                        <ul><li>Use AND searches in Academy to search for all the search terms you specify. For example, type <var>shopping AND cart</var> to make sure each search result includes both the words "shopping" and "cart".</li><li>To search for one word or the other one, put OR between each search query. For example, if you type <var>payone OR payment</var> the found articles will contain either word "payone" or "payment".</li><li>To exclude specific search terms from the search results, put NOT before them. For example, type <var>payment NOT payone</var>: the query will not return any results with word "payone" in them.</li></ul></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Opening the sections. To find a specific piece of information, you can go to a section the information refers to (About, Features, Administration Interface, Back-End etc.), and search there.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To simplify documentation search and categorization, we mark some content with specific icons at the page title:</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/shoptype/B2B_Shop.png">
            </img> means that the feature / topic in question is applied to <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/understanding_spryker/demoshops.htm#b2b-demo-shop">B2B shop</a> only;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/shoptype/B2C_Shop.png" /> stands for <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/understanding_spryker/demoshops.htm#b2c-demo-shop">B2C shop</a> features / topics;</p>
        <p>
            <img src="../../Resources/Images/shoptype/Demoshop.png">
            </img> signifies that feature / topic refers to the <a href="http://documentation.spryker.com/about_spryker/about-spryker.htm#what-is-the--legacy-demoshop---">Legacy Demoshop</a> only.</p>
        <p>If content is not marked with either B2B, B2C or Demoshop icon, then it is generic and applies to all shop types.</p>
